   In the process of trusted software testing and verification, the user is playing an important role in presenting demand and acceptance results, but because of the particularity of the user, the ability to review the code is not enough to find loops in the program.   Therefore, this article explores a point of view from the user point of view, will be the user non-program design identity into the test program. Based on the binary tree model, this scheme proposes a method of semi-automatic sorting function FunTrust <I, O, N, P, T>, nested binary tree program flow chart. In the case of ignoring the specific code, Program flow display, by the user intuitive test code and design inconsistency, to find and solve the problem of potential problems, test software availability. Finally, the practice has proved that the method is effective.
